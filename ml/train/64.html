                     <div>
                      Post-modern Leftists in Europe are critical of the cartoons and supportive of the Islamic reaction to the cartoons. Their reasoning is simple: they say the cartoons were too provocative, and all cultures shoud respect one another since all cultures are functionally and structurally equivalent - (the basic presupposition of cultural relativism).
                      <br />
                      <br />These Leftists are REALLY saying, essentially, that the Muslims right to practice their religion the way they want to practice it (without any depictions of their prophet - and including their right to threaten non-believers --- who obviously have no such proscriptions) - TAKES PRECEDENCE over our own culture&apos;s freedom of the press and our inherent right to freedom of expression.
                      <br />
                      <br />What this means - in all practicality - is that they value the tenets of Muslim culture more than the tenets of own their own culture. They are willing to subordinate our own practice of universal human rights, to the Muslim&apos;s anti-humanitarian theocratic totalitarianism.
                      <br />
                      <br />WHY DO THEY FEEL THIS WAY?! WHY ARE THEY MORE DEFENSIVE OF ISLAM THAN THE WEST!? SIMPLE: The post-modern Left is anti-West, and anti-Judeo-Christian. WHY?! SIMPLE: They&apos;ve been brain-washed to believe that Third World poverty is the result of First World colonialism and imperialism - (as if the Third World was once rich or would have been rich if the West had never &quot;interfered&quot; with them).
                      <br />
                      <br />These post-modern Leftists believe that Western Civilization is basically harmful to the environment and harmful to humanity, and that Westerners - especially practicing Judeo-Christians - live an inauthentic life, a life alienated from reality, a life where people have been alienated from their sexuality and from nature. They still believe in the Marcussian Revolution.
                      <br />
                      <br />They believe that the USSR and China failed becasue it wasn&apos;t &quot;true Marxism&quot;, and that Marxism never took root in the UK or in the USA because the Anglo-Amecian proletariat had become ENBOURGOISEIFIED. By gaining middle-class living standards, the working class lost its identity as an exploited class; this process they call enbourgoisification. And it makes us in the West inauthentic, in the minds of post-modern Leftists.
                      <br />
                      <br />Post-modern Leftists believe that people of the Third World - what used to be called &quot;primitive cultures - live an authentic life, with values which are in harmony with their environment and culture. And they believe that the West has a lot to make up to the Third World. And the Muslim Wolrd is a major part of the Third World to whom we owe a lot.
                      <br />
                      <br />These post-modern Leftists see Israel as an outpost of colonialism, and the GWOT as the just desserts for colonialism. The post-modern Left is fond of saying - as regards 9/11 and it&apos;s after math: &quot;The chickens have come home to roost.&quot;
                      <br />
                      <br />When the Third World threatens the First, the post-modern Left sides with the Third World. They think this is just. hence their knee-jerk defence of the 
                      <a href="http://astuteblogger.blogspot.com/2006/02/cartoon-intifada.html"><span>CARTOON INTIFADA.</span><br /> </a>
                      <br />In fact: THE POST-MODERN LEFT HAS IT ALL WRONG. Prosperity is a by-product of individual ingenuity and enterprise. When people (anywhere) are liberated and are free to exploit their own ingenuity through enterprise, propserity results.
                      <br />
                      <br />Lack of liberty, the lack of rule of law, the lack of transparency, and the lask of industrialization and free trade are the true roots of Third World poverty.
                      <br />
                      <br />The more the Third World EMULATES the First World - (and becomes a part of it though trade), the richer they become and the higher the standards of living they achieve. Post-Maoist China proves this, as does post-Soviet Russia, and Zimabawe. SIMPLY PUT: 
                      <a href="http://astuteblogger.blogspot.com/2006/01/more-proof-that-prosperity-is-by_19.html">The more liberty the people have - and the more transparency and accountability their government has - THE RICHER PEOPLE GET.</a>
                      <br />
                      <br />So, in summary: post-modern Leftists are hypocritical when they adopt culturally relativist positions AND side with Muslims in the
                      <a href="http://astuteblogger.blogspot.com/2006/02/cartoon-intifada.html"> <span>CARTOON INTIFADA</span></a>. By siding with vestigial totalitarianists they deny that there are universal human rights, and basically say that Muslims have more right to practice their religion than we have the right to practice freedom of the press. AND, by siding with these vestigial totalitarianists, they basically consign Muslims to an inferior future of continued poverty, degradation, and violence.
                      <br />
                      <br />I CAN PROVE THEY ARE WRONG TO DENY UNIVERSALISM: If there are no universal human rights, then there is no basis for outlawing slavery or infanticide or genocide, for without the notion that all humans everywhere are entitled to inalienable human rights solely by virtue of their being human there is no basis for one nation or culture to interfere with ANY PRACTICE in another culture or nation. The only MORAL basis for such interference is the notion of universality. (Post-modern Leftists believe that only when there&apos;s cross-cultural or multilatertal/international CONSENSUS can there legitimately be any international or cross-cultural interference. Cross-cultural consensus has relaced universal values for the post-modern Left. Hence their over-valuation of the UN, and hence the result that humanity has JUST RECENTLY allowed countless genocides to occur - all of which could have been AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN stopped. But nothing was done and MILLIONS DIED. becasue no consensus was reached.)
                      <br />
                      <br />And this is simply no longer a notion that the Left believes in. The lack of a belief in universality is basically what divides old-time liberal from the post-modern Leftists. Old-time liberals - like FDR and Truman and JFK - were hawks. They believed that all people everywhere deserved to be free. They&apos;d be neo-cons today, not post-modern Leftists. They defend the cartoons and the cartoonists, and not those who threaten our hard-won liberties. They&apos;d condemn those who would deny us our human rights - whether they did so in the name of Marxism or Islamicism.
                      <br />
                      <br />I believe that every woman born everywhere is entitled to do whatever she can achieve in life and that shew should not be forced to marry her married cousin, and not be prevented from learning to read, and not be forced to cover herself in public, and not be the victim of &quot;honor-killings.&quot;
                      <br />
                      <br />And I believe that a people who use religion to foment these practices are ESSENTIALLY ANTI-HUMAN AND EVIL AND SHOULD BE WIPED OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.The ideology which foments these practices is worse than Nazism - which we unabashedly wiped out last century.
                      <br />
                      <br />I do not think it right to sit idly by as Muslim women are SYSTEMATICALLY denied their human rights. I do not think it&apos;s okay for my fellow Westerners to be threatened for saying what they believe.
                      <br />
                      <br />People who systematically degradate (and often murder) their own mothers and sisters and daughters and female cousins are of course more than happy to mistreat us, to lie to us, to chreat us, and to kill us. Anybody who can murder their own daughter to &quot;re-gain family honor&quot; can of course commit more horrible atrocities against infidels. And they will if we let them. THEY ARE: 9/11; Atocha; 7/7; the Weding attck in Amman. And now they threaten us for publishing cartoons!
                      <br />
                      <br />WELL: When they seek to deny us our inalienable human rights must be taught a lesson they shall never forget. If we do not, then they will try to get away with more the next time. We must teach then a harsh lesson, and the sooner the better.
                      <br />
                      <br />WHAT MIGHT THIS BE? Well, for starters we should cut them off from our civilization: no trade, no services, no goods, no travel, no contact for any nation which doesn&apos;t respect Universal Human Rights. They must give ALL WOMEN UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE, and end polygamy and endogamy AT ONCE! If they do not, then, we should isolate them - ostracize them.
                      <br />
                      <br />They must be made to pay for their inhuamnity to their own. And for their attacks on our civilization. 
                      <span></span>
                      <br />
                      <br />Appeasing them sends the opposite message: it says threatening us WORKS! Which means: THREATEN US SOME MORE! Everytime we let them badger us into ANY submission we are appeasing them and this only enpocurages them to do it again - only worse the next time.
                      <br />
                      <br />So ... it&apos;s time to draw the line. It&apos;s overdue.

                      <br />
                      <br />The ONLY nations that voted to support Iran: Venezuela, Cuba and Syria. (Five abstained.) This is the current roster for the AXIS OF EVIL, (remember, North Korea doesn&apos;t get a vote here). And lookie here: they&apos;re ALL socialist nations (Syria is Baathist and Baathism is Pan-Arabic socialism). COINCIDENCE!? Nope. Not only is socialism the &quot;opiate of the

                       <span>I think it is no coincidence that these acts of violence are occurring with the issue of Iran now reaching yet another, critical point.

                      <br />
                      <br />I think the CARTOON INTIFADA first an attempt to cow us into 
                      <span>dhimmitude</span>, but it is also a coordinated attempt at misdirection - to make us take the eye off the &quot;Iran/Assad ball&quot; and to dissuade us from making them accountable to international law. It must not be looked at in isolation, but be seen as part of a global effort of the enemy.
                      <br />
                      <br />LASKY IS RIGHT: EXPECT MORE, ONLY WORSE. AND EXPECT IT ANYWHERE AT ANYTIME.

                      </div>
                      <br />This intifada, 
                      <span>THE CARTOON INTIFADA</span>, like ALL the previous ones - is ONLY a pretext for global jihad, (
                      <span>an SOP of the ROP</span>). The cartoons are just an excuse for the jihadists to rile up the Arab Muslim masses to attack the West - and to make the West cower into dhimmitude.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>Most intifadas are started this way - by way of local excuses:</span>
                      <br />
                      <blockquote>
                       The 
                       <span>&quot;PARIS INTIFADA&quot;</span> was supposedly started (that is, if you ask a local Muslim!) because a few Arab Muslim youths were chased by the police into a train-yard where they were &quot;accidentally&quot; electrocuted. This was just an excuse - a trumped up reason for them to try to intimidate the French - and by extension us, The Free World.
                       <br />
                       <br />The so-called &quot;
                       <span>SECOND INTIFADA</span>&quot; - which Arafat initiated after declining to accept all the territories and half of Jerusalem from Barak- was merely a pretext for continued war against Israel. This proved to most observers (from Barak to Dennis Ross) that Arafat never really wanted peaceful co-existence or a negotiated two-state solution, and merely used OSLO as a Trojan Horse, (as Bibi and Arik had always said. YUP: THEY WERE RIGHT!).
                       <br />
                       <br />Separate, independent nationhood for Arabs in the so-called &quot;occupied territories is just a pretext. Meshal - the head of Hamas - admits this. He admits that Hamas wants all of Israel to be subsumed into the 
                       <span>ummah (see below)</span>. In fact, one cannot possibly argue against this because the PLO was actually founded BEFORE 1967, before what&apos;s presently called &quot;occupied territory&quot; was even &quot;occupied.&quot; To the islamofascists of the PLO - and Hamas - ALL of Israel is on Arab Muslim land and all of Israel must be erased. Ahmadinejad and Binladen and Zarqawi and Zawahiri merely say what most others believe and won&apos;t say.
                       <br />
                       <br />The so called insurgency in the Sunni provinces of Iraq is an intifada too; it&apos;s &quot;
                       <span>THE SUNNI INTIFADA</span>&quot; - and it isn&apos;t really about American occupation, either. All that the so called insurgents REALLY want is to re-establish an islamofascist state.
                       <br />
                       <br />And Algerians have been fighting jihadoterrorism for a decade; hundreds of thousands of Arab Muslims have died in this conflict. (That&apos;s HUNDREDS OF TIMES more Arabs than have been killed by Israelis!). &quot;
                       <span>THE ALGERIAN INTIFADA</span>&quot; is not merely about the islamothugs trying to establish a Taliban-like state in Algeria. That&apos;s just their immediate, LOCAL aim.
                       <br />
                       <br />And there&apos;s a THAILAND INTIFADA, and a FILIPINO INTIFADA and there are little intifada&apos;s all over the globe. Each seemingly inflamed by LOCAL issues but all really part of the global aspirations of jihad. GLOBAL JIHAD. They want to re-establish the Caliphate from Spain to the Philippines. And place it under extremist rule. Along the way, they will kill or convert - OR THREATEN INTO DHIMMITUDE - everyone who gets in their way.
                       <br />
                      </blockquote>
                      <span>Each &quot;intifada&quot; is a little battlefield and a LITTLE SUDATENLAND, of sorts, as the islamofascists systematically seek to diminish the grasp and reach of the Free World. Like Sudatenland and Hitler, our enemy often promises that the current &quot;dust up&quot; is really just about this narrow local issue. As if the tumult and threats we&apos;ve been witnessing in the Muslim world is REALLY JUST ABOUT CARTOONS. It ain&apos;t. Cartoons are merely the proverbial finger before they take the hand.</span>
                      <br />
                      <br />In terms of territory, they demand we surrender: the West Bank; the Sunni provinces; the Moro Islands; Bali; Kashmir; Israel; Anadalusia; Albania and Kosovo; Serbia; Afghanistan and Pakistan and eventually all of Arabia. 
                      <span>Each is a little Sudatenland if taken on it&apos;s own. Together it&apos;s the old Caliphate.</span>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>There are figurative Sudatenlands, too,</span> which then enemy wants us to surrender along the way, like our 
                      <span>Freedom of Expression</span> - how we dress, what we say and write and draw and paint, and the music we play and listen to, the movies we make and watch - the websites we construct and visit. They want us to SURRENDER this, too.
                      <br />
                      <br />And they don&apos;t want to allow anyone to have 
                      <span>Freedom of Religion</span>, not even fellow Muslims who are Sufi or Shia. And they don&apos;t want anyone to have
                      <span> Freedom from Want</span> - their societies a rife with poverty.
                      <br />
                      <br />And of course, they don&apos;t want anybody to have 
                      <span>Freedom from Fear</span>; fear is their ONLY weapon; they love inflicting fear more than they love life.
                      <br />
                      <br />It&apos;s long passed time people in the West saw the enemy for what they are: the most evil, despicable, vile inhumane force that has EVER walked on the face of the Earth.
                      <br />
                      <br />And therefore, it&apos;s long passed time everyone saw this CARTOON INTIFADA for what it is: an excuse for the enemy to attack us and make us retreat, and cower before them and their nihilistic, misogynistic, xenophobic, racist creed.
                      <br />
                      <br />FDR - who defeated Nazism - would be shoulder-to-shoulder with the cartoonists and Bush. HECK: maybe he&apos;d be out front, leading Bush, exhorting him to be even more comprehensive in the counter-attack against jihadism. YUP: maybe if FDR was president he&apos;d of FIRE-BOMBED Tora Bora and Waziristan and Ramadi and Fallujah and every other outpost of islamofascism. YUP: ya gotta hand it to FDR - and Harry S Truman: they didn&apos;t pull punches with fascism the way George W Bush does with jihadoterrorism. YUP: I&apos;m beginning to think the &quot;W&quot; stands for WIMP!
                      <br />
                      <br />And we&apos;ll never win this war by wimping out, by surrendering a little Sudatenland here and a little Sudatenland there. We&apos;ll never win by giving into little intifadas, or kidnappings or beheadings or suicide bombings - OR WORSE. We&apos;ll only win when we smash the enemy and utterly defeat them. No matter how long it takes.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>And no matter how many peace-loving, tolerant &quot;moderate&quot; Muslims get angry... and call for our heads!</span>

                      <span>WHERE&apos;S THE OUTRAGE .... on the part of artists and writers!?<br /><br />Has the WGA or PEN (or any other artists&apos; or writers&apos; organizations) voiced ANY support for the Denmark?<br /><br />NOPE. They are as silent about this afront to freedom of expression as they were about the murder of Theo van Gogh. They SHOULD be as supportive to Denmark as the dozen or so European newspaper which have reprinted the cartoons in a fabulous display of solidarity with Denmark.</span>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>WHY IS THIS!? Because these organizations - like the MSM itself - are dominated by post-modern Leftists who hate the West and Amecia and Bush and believe that the West is simply reaping the seeds of imperialism, colonialism, Judeo-Christian-centrism and &quot;American Cultural Hegemony.&quot;<br /><br />NEED PROOF!? Well, it&apos;s been 3 days since the BLOGOSPHERE has proved that the entire protest was the result of LIES about PHONY cartoons spread by islamicist imams from Denmark, lies spread deliberately to inflame a backlash in Muslim Arabia. Yet the MSM has STILL not reported this.<br /><br />Instead, the MSM is fanning the flames by continuing to portray this story as if the bad guys were the callous cartoonists and bellicose newspapers, instead of the intolerant Muslims. They ignore the fact that this is simply a freedom of expression issue.</span>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>These Leftist appeasers - who either appease by criticizing the newspapers which have run the cartoons, or who by silence approve of the threats to free speech of the Muslims - have NO principles except hatred for the West and America and Bush.<br /><br />Writers and artists who fail to defend the cartoonists and their publishers are scum.<br /><br />Writers and artists should also declare an &quot;International Day of Anger&quot; - AT THE ISLAMOFASCISTS. (Stories on Islamofascist anger <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004441.htm">HERE</a> and <a href="http://telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/02/03/wcart03.xml">HERE</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020202720.html">HERE</a> and<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060203/ap_on_re_mi_ea/prophet_drawings"> HERE</a> and <a href="http://telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/02/02/wcart02.xml">HERE</a> and <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/b2481314-942c-11da-82ea-0000779e2340.html">HERE</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/02/02/gaza.cartoon/index.html">HERE </a>and <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1700798,00.html">HERE</a>.)<br /><br /><span>UPDATE: </span><a href="http://gatesofvienna.blogspot.com/2006/02/prophet-cartoons-hit-msm-in-usa.html">GATES OF VIENNA reports that FOX and CNN have finally reported on the matter. </a><br /><br />STILL: Where&apos;s their outrage at the islamofascists would blackmail us into surrendering our free press!?

The message is that we must kick this disgusting habit....</span>

Second is Mexico. Persian Gulf (including Saudi) oil amounted to about one-sixth of our imports and one-tenth of our total petroleum use last November.</span>

Straw has never once criticized anti-Semitic cartoons run by the Guradian - and other Eurpoean newspapers, but now he criticizes anti-Islam cartoons. WHY? becasue of the uproar in the Islamic world. What he and other leaders should be syaing to the Islamic world is &quot;GROW UP, OR SHUT UP!&quot; All his appeasement does is invite more blackmail and enocurage more dhimmitude.

                      FISA was - as EVERYONE acknowledges - the result of the REACTION to Nixon&apos;s misuse of executive powers. (
                      <span>I repeat: THE MISUSE of executive powers - and NOT the invention of imaginary executive powers. The SCOTUS in the 1972 Keith decision reiterated that the POTUS does have the constitutional authority to order sigint of FOREIGN threats; the SCOTUS held that the threat in the Keith case WASN&apos;T FOREIGN, and therefore it was OUTSIDE the scope of constitutional presidential authority</span>.)
                      <br />
                      <br />FISA was enacted in the first half of the first term of the very next elected president - the first half of the first and only term of the worst president of all time: Jimmy &quot;I love Hamas&quot; Carter.
                      <br />
                      <br />What IMMEDIATELY followed the passage of FISA was (a) The Fall of the Shah to Khomeini and the islamofascists; (b) The Invasion of Afghanistan by the USSR; and (c) The Ascension by coup d&apos;etat of Saddam. Did FISA CAUSE all these events - (events which DIRECTLY created the every crisis we are in today!)? NO. But the ETHOS which fomented FISA DID! It&apos;s an ethos that argues that a strong POTUS is more a danger to us than our overtly avowed enemies. This ethos also produced:

                      <p>(1) The <span>unilateral disarmament movement</span> of the 1960&apos;s thru the 1980&apos;s (or surrendering to the USSR&apos;s war machine which spent 40% of its GDP on armaments!); (2) The anti-industry/anti-free trade/&quot;green movement&quot; (or surrendering to <span>isolationism and protectionism and Ludditism)</span>; (3) The <span>anti-2ND Amendment movement</span> (which is tantamount to surrendering one&apos;s basic human right to self-defense, and surrendering to criminals); and (4)<span> Multi-culturalism</span> - which is essentially surrendering American culture -- (which has grown through the ASSIMILATION of foreign cultures into American culture, and which has always taught that the American political system best allows for maximal individual liberty, which in turns creates the prosperity immigrants seek for themselves and their descendents) -- to a polyglot mosaic of cultural and moral relativism. (5) The so-called &quot;<span>peace dividend</span>&quot; - which was nothing more than the hollowing out the armed forces of this country. It was as foolish in the 1990&apos;s as it was in the 1920&apos;s and 1930&apos;s. </p>

                      And just as an importantly, it&apos;s an ethos which valorizes appeasement, and dreads valiant direct open and honest confrontation of evil. Valorizing appeasement has always led to, and will always only ever lead to weakness, and that always only invites adventurism of our real enemies and - if it&apos;s not checked in time - to our own defeat.
                      <br />
                      <br />Reagan repudiated the ethos of retreat and defeat. And the result of his successful presidency was a rebirth of American strength and the defeat of the USSR and the liberation of 500 MILLION people - ALL of whom are better of now than they were under Soviet tyranny and hegemony. As a result of the fall of the USSR, we were also liberated - our foreign policy was no longer shackled to the Cold War and we became free to focus our attention on unsavory allies whose allaince we needed only in the context of the Cold War.
                      <br />
                      <br />Bush&apos;s 21st century foreign policy - of aggressively attacking tyranny, and of boldly spreading democracy - (by attacking authoritarianism, totalitarianism and islamofascism) - is ONLY possible in a post-Cold War world. And it&apos;s the noblest of causes; one for which FDR and Truman and JFK toiled. It was taken up again by Reagan - and since 9/11, it has been taken up by Bush.
                      <br />
                      <br />We mustn&apos;t let the appeasers and self-doubters ever get back in control of our foreign policy. REMEMEBR: they&apos;re the folks who wrote FISA, who were ready to unilaterally disarm and to perpetually co-exist with the USSR. Now these very same people - Teddy Jo Kennedy and Genghis Kerry - would rather attack Bush than our true enemy -- and they&apos;d like to force our armed forces and our intel services to fight the enemy with one hand tied behind their backs.
                      <br />
                      <br />THAT WON&apos;T HAPPEN ON BUSH&apos;S WATCH. NOPE: It&apos;s still morning in America. And, it&apos;s still morning for the rest of the world too, if we don&apos;t succumb to the ethos of retreat and defeat. At the very least, we owe it to those who sacrificed in the past for our liberty, and to those who are sacrificing right now for our liberty. Most of all, we owe it to generations to come - EVERYWHERE.

                      &quot;Addicted to oil&quot; was a pure BS appeal to centrists and Dems. And a bad policy based on bad principles - namely spending federal revenues on what is essentially a private business/free market matter.
                      <br />
                      <br />If we want to lessen our dependence on foreign oil let&apos;s just simply drill for more here - we got PLENTY of proven reserves right off the coasts of California and Florida and in Alaska - FOR STARTERS! And then let&apos;s make sure there are no state or federal regulations preventing the construction of some more coal-oil conversion plants and mine for more coal RIGHT HERE. Four USA states - Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Idaho and Wyoming - have more energy (in convertible coal) than all of Arabia and the Persian Gulf combined!
                      <br />
                      <br />IOW: All we really need to do is extract the energy got!
                      <br />
                      <br />Bush&apos;s appeal to invest in new energy technology (and his promise of a big Federal boondoggle to support it) is just like his Harriet Miers nomination: A stupid play for consensus with the Democrats when what he should be doing is sticking to his guns - and his core beliefs and his base.
                      <br />
                      <br />Alito was a BETTER pick than Miers. It made the people who elected him HAPPY.
                      <br />
                      <br />And on the energy issue, Bush should have stuck to his guns - and his principles (and his base&apos;s issues and values), and just told Congress to OPEN ANWR - and OPEN the coast off California and OPEN the coast off of Florida.
                      <br />
                      <br />Bush won&apos;t gain in the polls by appealing to the Dem/Left. The Teddy Jo Kennedy/Genghis Kerry Pelosi/Dean/Reid/Michael Moore/Cindy Sheehan crowd will NEVER give him credit for anything. He shouldn&apos;t angle for it. It&apos;s DUMB.
                      <br />
                      <br />The WH advisors have got encourage BUSH TO BE BUSH! That&apos;s who we voted for. Not some guy pandering to the Dems and the MSM.

                       &quot;... the transcript of an interview [BY the nedia line] with Mahmoud A-Zahhar, the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The interview was conducted ahead of the January 25th Palestinian parliamentary elections. Hamas, for the first time, participated in these elections, and won 76 out of 132 parliamentary seats.
                       <br /> 
                       <br />During the interview, A-Zahhar revealed his movement&apos;s political and economic agendas, reiterating the notion that his movement will never recognize Israel.
                       <br /> 
                       <br />He also said he expects to see Hamas ministers in the next Palestinian government. In addition, A-Zahhar uncovered in detail Hamas&apos; plan to reconstruct and redefine the Palestine Liberation Organization&apos;s (PLO) responsibilities, according to which it would represent the entire Palestinian nation, inside and outside the Palestinian Authority (P.A.).

                        TML: What is the final goal of Hamas?
                        <br /> 
                        <br />A-Z: If you ask any Palestinian or Muslim, wherever he lives – in America or in Britain or in Indonesia – he would tell you that according to the religious point of view, this land is part of the Arab and Muslim nations. This means, that there is no other option but to reunify this land once again.
                        <br /> 
                        <br />TML: What is &apos;this land&apos; that you are talking about? Are you talking about the whole of Israel?
                        <br /> 
                        <br />A-Z: I understand where you are headed, and I will answer you.
                        <br /> 
                        <br />First of all this Palestinian land, and all the Arabic nation, is all part of the same area. In the past, there was no independent Palestinian state; there was no independent Jordanian state; and so on. There were regions called Iraq or Egypt, but they were all part of one country. That is why it is not permitted to [agree to] establish separate countries, which was the case after the Sykes-Picot Agreement [1916].
                        <br /> 
                        <br />Our main goal is to establish a great Islamic state, be it pan-Arabic or pan-Islamic.
                        <br /> 
                        <br />Therefore, it is not allowed to establish an Arabic state over the land of Palestine alone.
                        <br /> 
                        <br />Also, remember this land is still occupied. To sum up, the Islamic and traditional views reject the notion of establishing an independent Palestinian state.
                        <br /> 
                        <br />The Islamists&apos; view, which Hamas adheres to, is that a great Muslim state must be established, with Palestine being a part of it.
                        <br /> 
                        <br />Within this state, Israel has no place – its history is different, its language is different, its religion is different, its culture is different, and its security and political affiliations are different. This is the view of Hamas movement.
                        <br /> 
                        <br />TML: Is Hamas ever going to recognize the state of Israel?
                        <br /> 
                        <br />A-Z: Let me ask you a question, does the Egyptian people recognize Israel? No. That is why it did not normalize relations with Israel. This is not a view held only by Hamas. This is a view held by anyone who believes in Islam.&quot;

                      A religious leader of an Islamic group in Copenhagen - Abu Laban - has been CAUGHT speaking with two tongues:
                      <br />
                      <blockquote>
                       <span>In the Danish media he is quoted as saying he is </span>
                       <span>against </span>
                       <span>the widespread boycott of danish goods in the middle east.</span>
                       <br />
                       <br />
                       <span>An hour later on Al Jizeera TV he says that he thinks it is a great thing that the arab nations and people defend islam through the boycott.</span>
                      </blockquote> I guess this is the Imam&apos;s idea of free speech! Heh. Actually, this is an old Arab Muslim trick which Arafat and Abbas used all the time. It plays upon the &quot;willing suspense of disbelief&quot; of Left-wing doves and appeasers. Smart people donlt fall for this trick becasue smart people know how to tell when these folks are lying. HOW?! THEY&apos;RE LIPS ARE MOVING! (Badabumbump!)

                      <br />
                      <span>AND ANSWER ME THIS: Do you think ANY Arab Palestani can voice opposition to HAMAS (or IJ or Al Aksa or the PFLP or any other terrorist group) without FEAR OF REPRISAL!? Of course they can&apos;t. And in that atmosphere of intimidation and fear NO ELECTION CAN BE REGARDED AS FAIR OR TRUE OR JUST. Or valid. No matter what Jimmy Carter says.</span>

                      <span>AMONA, West Bank -- Club-wielding riot troops dragged away thousands of stone-throwing Jewish settlers from rooftops and behind barbed wire Wednesday, evacuating this illegal West Bank outpost in the fiercest clash over settlements since Israel&apos;s Gaza pullout.</span>
                      <br />
                      <br />With courage and sadness, Israel&apos;s goverment is taking on the illegal settlers and dismantling illegal settlements. (MORE STORIES

                      <br />
                      <br />In stark contrast, Abbas and the rest of the so called &quot;Palestinian&quot; so called &quot;moderates&quot; (HA!) have done NOTHING, ZERO, BUPKUS! They have not disarmed one single solitary terrorist - let alone a single terrorist group AS THEY WERE LEGALLY BOUND TO DO BY &quot;THE ROAD MAP FOR PEACE.&quot;
                      <br />
                      <br />No deal with these Arab palestinians is worth the paper it is written on. Israel must forge ahead with any and all UNILATERAL moves which make it more secure. SCREW THE FRIGGIN ARAB PALESTANIS! SCREW&apos;EM!

                      <span>&quot;... hand wringing about Hamas&apos; recent political victory over Fatah is a little like feeling bad about the way Hitler&apos;s S.S. sucker-punched all those nice S.A. Brownshirts back in Germany in 1934.&quot;</span>

                      <span>At the time, they think it we in the West too far when we threaten sanctions against Syria and Iran - in Syria&apos;s case for murdering Hariri, and in Iran&apos;s case for lying about uranium enrichment for 18 years, and for illegally trying to make nuclear weapons (YEAH, ILLEGAL: Iran is a signatory to the NPT!).</span>

                      <br />

                       <span>France Soir said it had published the cartoons to show that &quot;religious dogma&quot; had no place in a secular society. ...

                       <span>The offices of the Danish newspaper that first published the caricatures, Jyllands-Posten, had to be evacuated on Tuesday because of a bomb threat. ...

                       <blockquote>
                        <span>Clinton described as “appalling” the 12 cartoons published in a Danish newspaper in September and causing uproar in the Muslim world.</span>

                        <span>“None of us are totally free of stereotypes about people of different races, different ethnic groups, and different religions ... there was this appalling example in northern Europe, in Denmark ... these totally outrageous cartoons against Islam,” he said.</span>
                       </blockquote><span></span></span>
                      <span>I have never ONCE heard Clinton complain about the horrifying and anti-Semitic depeictions of Jews - and of Sharon, for example - which CONSTANTLY APPEAR in the Arab Muslim press - AND IN THE EU&apos;s LEFT-WING PRESS! - like ones of Sharon depicted as bloodsucking cannibal eating Arabs.</span>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>Clinton and his fellow travellers on the enemy-appeasing Left - like Carter and Sheehan and Dean and Pelosi and Reid and Murtha and Teddy Jo Kennedy and Genghis Kerry - are running are partly responsible for the mess we&apos;re in:<br />
                       <blockquote>
                        Carter helped Khomeini takeover Iran, let the USSR take over Afgfhanistan, and let Saddam take over Iraq. Clinton ignored al Qaeda - for his entire 8 years in office, and passed up on SEVERAL chances to get Binladen.
                       </blockquote></span>
                      <span>It is fitting and proper that now BOTH OF THESE USELESS LEFT-WING ENEMY-APPEASING DOVES should trake the side of the those who would limit our freedoms. They are scum.<br /><br /><span>NOTE</span>: I suspect that Clinton will be getting a lot of &quot;donations&quot; from <a href="http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=local_news&amp;month=february2006&amp;file=local_news2006020133628.xml">his new Arab Muslim &quot;friends&quot; (today&apos;s Arab press is all over him with praise!</a>) and I suspect that this is one MAJOR reason for his comments: Clinton is doing what he and his fellow travellers have always done - pander for money.<br /><br />REMEMBER: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/10/10/freeh.clinton/">FORMER FBI DIRECTOR LOUIS FREEH said that Clinton went all soft on the Saudi in 2000 because he was more concerned about getting a donation for his presidential library than in making foreign policy that was good for the USA and our allies. </a><br /><br />More on this corrupt philandering perjurious piece of excrement&apos;s pandering to Arabs for money <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/5137">HERE</a> and<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/10/8/101411.shtml"> HERE</a>.<br /><br />More on France growing a spine <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4669360.stm">HERE </a>and <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,251-2020190,00.html">HERE</a>.<br /><br /><span>UPDATE-UPDATE: </span><a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/breaking_news/breakingnews.php?id=76938">Well, the fwench have shown their true colors - YELLOW: They fired the editior who published the cartoons!

                      First
                      <a href="http://www.exposetheleft.com/2006/01/23/carterhamas/"> Jimmy Carter called HAMAS &quot;so called terrorists&quot;</a> and then 
                      <a href="http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=18968_That_Didnt_Take_Long&amp;only">he said we should continue funding the PA even though it is now run by a genocidal racist terrorist organization</a>.
                      <br />
                      <br />Meanwhile,
                      <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/006254.php"> Mubarak and leading figures in the Egyptian goverment are saying that HAMAS must FIRST renounce terrorism and accept israel&apos;s right to exist BEFORE being allowed to form a government.</a>
                      <br />
                      <br />Well, it&apos;s simple really: Mubarak doesn&apos;t want a &quot;little Iran&quot; on it&apos;s border - (and neither do Jordan or Lebanon).
                      <br />
                      <br />If we want ANY CHANCE at getting Hamas to change, then we must present a united front on this issue - and then follow up with a boycott. Hamas must be confronted and defeated - NOT appeased.
                      <br />
                      <br />Whuich is why appeasing jerks like Carter and Clinton - and now Wolfowitz - should keep their appeasing mouths shut!

                       <span><span>The Palestinian Government should continue to receive international aid despite concerns over last week&apos;s election victory by Islamic militant group Hamas, World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz said in an interview today. </span></span>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                       <span><br />Speaking to the Financial Times, Mr Wolfowitz urged Russia, the European Union, the US and the United Nations to allow the bank to continue working in the region. The so-called Quartet of world powers has said Hamas must reject violence and recognise the right of Israel to exist or risk losing the aid.</span>
                       <br />
                       <br />
                       <span>&quot;What we do now depends on what the Quartet asks us to do,&quot; Mr Wolfowitz told the British newspaper. &quot;I hope they will ask us to stay.&quot; ... It will help the whole process if the life of the average Palestinian improves. We ought to be the last people to disengage.&quot;</span>
                       <br />
                       <br />
                       <span>The bank chairs the committee of donors for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. <span>The Palestinian Authority is the biggest single employer in the those areas and relies on foreign aid to stay afloat. </span></span>
                       <span>Last year, $802.4 million from the European Union and more than $264 million from the US.</span>

                     <div>
                      <span>HAMAS is a racist, misogynist, genocidal, theocratic terrorist organization which wants to erase Israel from the map - just like Ahmadinejad and Iran. <span>We should no more send the Palestanis aid them give Iran some nukes! </span>WHAT MAKES IT WORSE: on top of all that, these Palestanis run a socialist state, and we should not send money to prop up socialism ANYHWHERE! If the Palestanis want our aid, let them get it CONDITIONALLY from us - or get it elsewhere.</span>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>I am so incredibly upset at Wolfowitz; this is unpardonable. We must present a united front to the enemy. I&apos;d expect this kind of appeasement from Kofi or Chiraq or the Spainiards, but not Wolfie. Shame on him. Condi and Rummy and &quot;W&quot; should read him the RIOT ACT.<br /><br />WHY.... IF WE GIVE HAMAS MONEY, THEN WE&apos;D HAVE TO PUT OURSELVES ON OUR OWN TERRORIST LIST AS A STATE WHICH SUPPORTRS TERRORISM!<br /><br />That&apos;s why Wolfie&apos;s suggestion is absolutely INSANE! A SANE nation doesn&apos;t send aid to it&apos;s sworn enemies. I really don&apos;t care one whit if the Palestanis suffer as a result. ELECTIONS COUNT! ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES! They&apos;ve made their beds; now let them sleep in them.<br /><br />Just because THEY&apos;VE &quot;elected&quot; a bunch of out-and-out terrorists doesn&apos;t mean we have to change our policies regarding terrorists. NO! Now THEY have to accept the consequences of their choice!<br /><br />Sheesh.

                       </blockquote>We should put the same sanctions on HAMAS as we would on any genocidal regime - LIKE IRAN AND SYRIA AND NORTH KOREA AND ZIMBABWE. <span>NO AID FOR TERRORISTS. PERIOD.</span></span>

                      <span>&quot;Staying the course in Iraq is not an option or a policy for the MSM. I believe we must begin discussions for an immediate re-deployment of all MSM reporters from Iraq. Some claim the answer is to put even more reporters on the ground, but many of our reporters are already on their third deployment, our MSM cannot recruit to its current target, even as they lower recruiting standards. </span>

                      <span>My plan calls for a more rapid turnover of reporting in Iraq to the Iraqi reporters. MSM reporting in in Iraq is a major driving force behind the insurgency. The MSM has become a catalyst for violence. That&apos;s why we must redeploy reporters immediately!&quot;</span>

                     <div>
                      <br />(SATIRE OFF.) First, I want to extend my condolences to the Woodruff anf Vogt families. I am praying for their swift and complete recovery.
                      <br />
                      <br />Now.... here&apos;s the truth:
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT ACCIDENTALLY ONE OF THE VICTIMS IN THIS ATTACK WAS A CELEBRITY, THERE IS NO NEWS-WORTHINESS IN THIS STORY.</span>
                      <br />
                      <br />The enemy hasn&apos;t surrendered and they continue to target soft targets: mosques; funerals; weddings; children getting candy; Iraqi police; Iraqi Army and and reporters riding in Iraq Army vehicles.
                      <br />
                      <br />My sarcastic little pitch was only meant to further expose Murtha and his Leftie comrades, fellow appeasers, dupes, and doves who MISCONTRUE THE DATA (IOW: LIE) and advocate cutting and running. Cutting and running is a stupid policy and a worse strategy. Why does the Left advocate the wrong policy, a policy of premature withdrawal and appeasement!? THEY ALWAYS HAVE. They ran out on the South Vietnamese, they abandoned the CONTRAS, and they would do the same to the Iraqis - and the Israelis.
                      <br />
                      <br />The best strategy is to destroy the enemy. That&apos;s how you win wars. The best strategy is to intercept all the sigint - NO MATTTER WHERE IT EMANATES FROM AND NO MATTER WHERE IT GOES.
                      <br />
                      <br />The Leftie doves - and the Old Media and Democrat Party they control - would rather we purchased temporary truce at the price of eternal chains and everlasting shame. For that is all you ever really get when you give into blackmail and terror. The Left&apos;s denial of this fact is no different than their denial of the fact that socialism was not only a abject failure at providing the goods, but the single biggest cause of genocide in all of human history. We should no more listen to the Left now, then jump off a bridge. The Bolsheviks were wrong in 1917 and they are wrong now.

                       <span>In Iraq, and throughout the military, there is sympathy and concern for anchor Bob Woodruff and cameraman Doug Vogt, but there is also this question:</span>

I mean, you&apos;d think we lost the entire 1st Marine Division or something. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of grumbling from guys at all ranks about it. That&apos;s a really impolite and impolitic thing to say ... but it&apos;s what you would hear over here.&quot; ... &quot;The point that is currently being made (is that) that press folks are more important than mere military folks,&quot; a senior military officer told UPI Tuesday. </span>

                      <span></span>The troops are EXACTLY RIGHT: the Old Media care more about themselves than our troops our our cause. That&apos;s one big reason the Old Media is scum. And their ratings reflect the fact that patriotic Americans realize this!

                       <span>Last week, Col. Janis Karpinski told a panel of judges at the Commission of Inquiry for Crimes against Humanity Committed by the Bush Administration in New York that several women had died of dehydration because they refused to drink liquids late in the day. They were afraid of being assaulted or even raped by male soldiers if they had to use the women&apos;s latrine after dark.</span>

                       <br /> 
                       <span>The latrine for female soldiers at Camp Victory wasn&apos;t located near their barracks, so they had to go outside if they needed to use the bathroom. &quot;There were no lights near any of their facilities, so women were doubly easy targets in the dark of the night,&quot; Karpinski told retired US Army Col. David Hackworth in a September 2004 interview. It was there that male soldiers assaulted and raped women soldiers. So the women took matters into their own hands. They didn&apos;t drink in the late afternoon so they wouldn&apos;t have to urinate at night. They didn&apos;t get raped. But some died of dehydration in the desert heat, Karpinski said.<br /></span>

                        <span>First, and most obviously, no female master sergeants died in September 2003. A female sergeant died in July of 2003, but at least according to the website, she died of a non-hostile weapon discharge. Indeed, looking down the list there are only a few women where the cause of death is not pretty specific; so much for protecting privacy.</span>

Just the kind of scoundrel the Left adores: incompetent traitors. Now, she&apos;s also totally outted as a liar by

                      PUTIN IS GIVING DIRECT MILITARY AID AND ASSISTANCE TO OUR ENEMIES. RUSSIAN ANTI-AIRCRAFT MISSILES IN SYRIA MAY SOON BE AIMED AT THE JETS OF OUR TRUE ALLIES - AND MAYBE EVEN OUR OWN JETS.

                      We must get MUCH tougher with Putin. HE&apos;S A DANGEROUSLY BAD MAN. He is de-democratizing Russia while aiding our enemies - North Korea, Iran and Syria - and Venezuela. Fomenting democratic revolutions in Iran and Syria might short-circuit Putin&apos;s plans.
                      <br />
                      <br />So would a REAL DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA! IOW: I&apos;d like to see what we did in Serbia and Georgia and Ukraine duplicated in Russia! And soon.

                      <span>The controversial Jyllands-Posten cartoons were published in September. Er um... that&apos;s FIVE (5) months ago! SO: Why is this coming to a head NOW?</span>
                      <br />
                      <br />

                      <br />
                      <span>Denmark will not be cowed. Danes are not like the French or the Spanish. Danes are brave and true. In fact, 80% of the Danes oppose any capitulation to the Arab Muslims on this issue - and their parliament just voted to INCREASE their troops presence in Iraq! Even as Libya and other Arab Muslim nations withdraw their ambassadors and threaten a boycott of all Danish goods.</span>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>The Free World ought to boycott the Araba Muslim nations who boycott Denmark.</span> 
                      <span>The Danish shipping lines - two of the biggest in the world - ought to stop carrying Arab Muslim goods or shipping in or out of Arab Muslim nations which are boycotting them.</span>
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <span>We should let the intolerant, belligerant, xenophobic, misogynistic, cousin-marrying, honor-killing, freedom-hating, racist, genocidal Arab Muslim maniacs EAT SAND AND DRINK THEIR EFFIN&apos; OIL!<br /><br /></span>

                      <span></span>Sheesh. Can their hyperbolic hysyteria get any more ridiculous!? I mean, really: can these predictions be any more accurate than predictions about the deficit ten years hence, or the weather next week!? And gee, somebody tell me where the effin proof is that the global warming we&apos;re measuring is man-made!? PLEASE: somebody show me proof that the global warming we&apos;re experiencing isn&apos;t natural - like the several phases of warming and cooling that the planet has undergone many MANY times before?
                      <br />
                      <br />I think these predictions are every bit a hysterically wrong as the ones Paul Ehrlich made in the late 1960&apos;s. That&apos;s when they predicted GLOBAL COOLING and MASS STARVATION from pollution. (Er um, the planet&apos;s got 2 billion more people now and more of &apos;em are living better and longer than ever before! Not thanks to socialism!)
                      <br />
                      <br />I think that this hysterical talk about &quot;man-made global warming&quot; is nothing more than the demogogic ravings of a politically vapid and morally bankrupt Left.
                      <br />
                      <br />I wish they&apos;d just shut up already.
